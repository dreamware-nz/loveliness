# Loveliness

A clustered graph database built on [LadybugDB](https://github.com/LadybugDB/ladybug) — like Elasticsearch is to Lucene, Loveliness is to LadybugDB.

> *A "loveliness" is the collective noun for a group of ladybugs.*

## What is this?

LadybugDB is a Kuzu fork — a fast, embedded, columnar graph engine with Cypher support. It's excellent on a single machine but has no clustering story. Loveliness wraps LadybugDB in a distributed layer: FNV-32a hash-based sharding, Raft consensus, cross-node query forwarding, Bloom filter shard routing, edge-cut replication, WAL-based disaster recovery, and a binary TCP transport for inter-node communication.

Every node runs a single Go binary. No external dependencies besides LadybugDB itself.

## Performance

Benchmarked on Apple M1 Pro, single node, 4 shards.

### At 15.7M nodes / 10M edges

| Query Type | P50 Latency | QPS (8 workers) |
|---|---|---|
| Point lookup (PK) | **425us** | **10,758** |
| Range filter (LIMIT 20) | **1.2ms** | 774 |
| Count all nodes | **2.1ms** | 457 |
| Count filtered (by city) | **56ms** | 15 |
| Aggregation (avg/min/max) | **57ms** | 16 |
| Group-by (10 cities) | **138ms** | 7 |
| 1-hop traversal | **673us** | 1,106 |
| 2-hop traversal | **162ms** | 5 |
| Variable-length path (1..3) | **1.8ms** | 369 |
| Mutual friends (triangle) | **1.1ms** | 838 |
| Shortest path (1..6) | **1.1ms** | 188 |
| Single write | **365us** | 2,526 |
| Merge/upsert | **5.0ms** | 190 |

### Bulk loading throughput

| Operation | Throughput | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node loading (COPY FROM) | **70–190K nodes/sec** | Degrades with B-tree depth at scale |
| Edge loading (2-pass) | **9.6K edges/sec** | Pass 1: ref nodes, Pass 2: edges |

### How we compare (estimated, 10–15M node scale)

| Benchmark | Loveliness | Neo4j | Memgraph | TigerGraph | Neptune | JanusGraph |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Point lookup P50 | **425us** | 200–500us | 50–150us | 300–800us | 5–15ms | 2–10ms |
| Concurrent read QPS | **10.7K** | 10–30K | 30–80K | 20–50K | 2–5K | 1–3K |
| 1-hop traversal P50 | **673us** | 200–600us | 100–300us | 500us–1ms | 5–20ms | 2–10ms |
| 2-hop traversal P50 | **162ms** | 10–50ms | 5–20ms | 20–80ms | 50–200ms | 50–200ms |
| Single write P50 | **365us** | 1–5ms | 100–300us | 1–2ms | 5–15ms | 5–20ms |
| Bulk load (nodes/sec) | **70–190K** | 30–80K online | 50–100K | 200K–1M | 50–150K | 10–50K |

**Where we win:** Point lookups (Bloom filter routing avoids unnecessary shard hits), single writes (lightweight transaction model), 1-hop traversals (edge-cut replication keeps most hops local), operational simplicity (single binary, no JVM, no external storage).

**Where we lose:** Multi-hop fan-out (scatter-gather + serialization per hop vs native pointer chasing), concurrent throughput ceiling (CGo boundary tax on every query), query optimizer maturity (Neo4j has 15 years of cost-based optimization).

**Where we're different:** Sharded from day one (Neo4j Fabric is an afterthought), columnar storage under the hood (analytics queries are better than expected for a graph DB), horizontal scalability by adding nodes.

### Inter-node transport: TCP+MessagePack vs HTTP+JSON

Internal cluster communication uses a binary TCP transport with MessagePack serialization instead of HTTP+JSON. Micro-benchmarks on 1000-row result sets:

| Scenario | HTTP+JSON | TCP+MsgPack | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single query (250 rows) | 551us | 269us | **2.1x** |
| Scatter-gather 4 shards | 1,339us | 658us | **2.0x** |
| 8-worker concurrent | 397us | 94us | **4.2x** |
| Marshal 1000 rows | 481us | 198us | **2.4x** |
| Unmarshal 1000 rows | 1,247us | 442us | **2.8x** |

```

**Key properties:**

- **Declared shard keys** — each node table has a PRIMARY KEY that determines shard routing via FNV-32a hashing
- **Bloom filter routing** — per-shard probabilistic index (5M keys, 1% FPR, ~6MB per shard) routes point lookups to a single shard instead of scatter-gathering
- **Edge-cut replication** — border nodes are replicated with full properties across shards so 1-hop traversals resolve locally
- **Aggregate pushdown** — AVG is rewritten to SUM+COUNT per shard, merged at the router; ORDER BY, LIMIT, and DISTINCT applied post-merge
- **Pipeline execution** — multi-hop traversals overlap across shards
- **WAL + backup/restore** — per-shard write-ahead log with backup to local disk or S3
- **Log-backed ingest queue** — async bulk loading with durable job state
- **TCP+MsgPack transport** — binary framed protocol for inter-node queries, 2-4x faster than HTTP+JSON

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- [LadybugDB](https://ladybugdb.com/) shared library installed (`curl -fsSL https://install.ladybugdb.com | sh`)
- Docker + Docker Compose (for cluster mode)

### Run a Single Node

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dreamware-nz/loveliness.git
cd loveliness

# Build (requires LadybugDB installed locally)
make build

# Start a single-node cluster
make run
# → listening on :8080 (HTTP), :9001 (TCP transport)
```

### Run a 3-Node Cluster

```bash
# Start all three nodes (node1 bootstraps, node2/node3 auto-join)
make docker

# Nodes:
#   node1 (leader): http://localhost:8080
#   node2:          http://localhost:8081
#   node3:          http://localhost:8082

# Tear down
make docker-down
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test          # verbose, all packages
make test-short    # quiet
make race          # with race detector
make cover         # coverage report
```

## How To Use It

### 1. Define Your Schema

LadybugDB requires schema before inserting data. The `PRIMARY KEY` you declare becomes the **shard key** — this is the value Loveliness hashes to decide which shard owns a node.

```bash
# Create a Person table — sharded on 'name'
curl -s localhost:8080/query -d '{
  "cypher": "CREATE NODE TABLE Person(name STRING, age INT64, city STRING, PRIMARY KEY(name))"
}'

# Create a relationship table
curl -s localhost:8080/query -d '{
  "cypher": "CREATE REL TABLE KNOWS(FROM Person TO Person, since INT64)"
}'
```

Schema DDL is automatically broadcast to all shards.

### 2. Create Data

```bash
# Alice → shard determined by fnv32a("Alice") % num_shards
curl -s localhost:8080/query -d '{
  "cypher": "CREATE (p:Person {name: '\''Alice'\'', age: 30, city: '\''Auckland'\''})"
}'

# Bob → different shard (probably)
curl -s localhost:8080/query -d '{
  "cypher": "CREATE (p:Person {name: '\''Bob'\'', age: 25, city: '\''Wellington'\''})"
}'

# Create a relationship (routed to Alice's shard — edges live with their source)
curl -s localhost:8080/query -d '{
  "cypher": "MATCH (a:Person {name: '\''Alice'\''}), (b:Person {name: '\''Bob'\''}) CREATE (a)-[:KNOWS {since: 2024}]->(b)"
}'
```

### 3. Bulk Loading

For large datasets, use the bulk loading endpoints or the async ingest queue.

**Synchronous bulk load:**
```bash
# Bulk load nodes from CSV
curl -s localhost:8080/bulk/nodes \
  -H "Content-Type: text/csv" \
  -H "X-Table: Person" \
  --data-binary @persons.csv

# Bulk load edges (two-pass for cross-shard performance)
# Pass 1: Create reference nodes
curl -s localhost:8080/bulk/edges \
  -H "X-Rel-Table: KNOWS" -H "X-From-Table: Person" -H "X-To-Table: Person" \
  -H "X-Refs-Only: true" \
  --data-binary @edges.csv

# Pass 2: Load edges (refs already exist)
curl -s localhost:8080/bulk/edges \
  -H "X-Rel-Table: KNOWS" -H "X-From-Table: Person" -H "X-To-Table: Person" \
  -H "X-Skip-Refs: true" \
  --data-binary @edges.csv
```

**Async ingest queue (for large loads):**
```bash
# Submit a node ingest job — returns immediately with job ID
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/ingest/nodes \
  -H "X-Table: Person" \
  --data-binary @persons.csv
# → {"job_id": "20260327-120000-abc123", "status": "pending"}

# Poll job status
curl -s localhost:8080/ingest/jobs/20260327-120000-abc123
# → {"status": "completed", "loaded": 5000000, ...}

# List all jobs
curl -s localhost:8080/ingest/jobs
```

The ingest queue spools the CSV to disk, returns 202 Accepted, and processes jobs sequentially in the background. Jobs survive server restarts.

### 4. Query Data

**Point lookup (single shard):**
```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/query -d '{
  "cypher": "MATCH (p:Person {name: '\''Alice'\''}) RETURN p.name, p.age, p.city"
}'
```

**Scan (scatter-gather):**
```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/query -d '{
  "cypher": "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age LIMIT 10"
}'
```

**Traversal:**
```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/query -d '{
  "cypher": "MATCH (a:Person {name: '\''Alice'\''})-[:KNOWS]->(b) RETURN b.name"
}'
```

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "columns": ["p.name", "p.age", "p.city"],
  "rows": [{"p.name": "Alice", "p.age": 30, "p.city": "Auckland"}],
  "stats": {"compile_time_ms": 0.12, "exec_time_ms": 0.45}
}
```

### 5. Disaster Recovery

**Backup and restore:**
```bash
# Stream a backup archive
curl -s localhost:8080/backup -o backup.tar.gz

# Restore from archive
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/restore --data-binary @backup.tar.gz

# WAL status
curl -s localhost:8080/wal/status
```

**CSV export:**
```bash
# Export a node table
curl -s localhost:8080/export/Person

# Export edges
curl -s localhost:8080/export/Person/edges/KNOWS
```

**S3 scheduled backups** are configured via environment variables (see Configuration).

### 6. Write Consistency

Control how many replicas must acknowledge a write by passing the `consistency` parameter:

| Level | Behavior | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `ONE` | Ack after primary write, async replicate | Fast writes, acceptable loss window |
| `QUORUM` | Ack after primary + 1 replica (default) | Safe default for most workloads |
| `ALL` | Ack after all replicas confirm | Maximum durability |

### 7. Monitor the Cluster

```bash
# Health check
curl -s localhost:8080/health | jq

# Cluster status
curl -s localhost:8080/cluster | jq

# Add a node
curl -s localhost:8080/join -d '{
  "node_id": "node-4",
  "raft_addr": "node4:9000",
  "grpc_addr": "node4:9001",
  "http_addr": "node4:8080"
}'
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LOVELINESS_NODE_ID` | `node-1` | Unique node identifier |
| `LOVELINESS_BIND_ADDR` | `:8080` | HTTP API listen address |
| `LOVELINESS_RAFT_ADDR` | `:9000` | Raft consensus address |
| `LOVELINESS_GRPC_ADDR` | `:9001` | TCP transport address (msgpack) |
| `LOVELINESS_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Base directory for shard data and Raft state |
| `LOVELINESS_SHARD_COUNT` | `3` | Total number of shards |
| `LOVELINESS_BOOTSTRAP` | `false` | Bootstrap a new cluster (first node only) |
| `LOVELINESS_PEERS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated list of peer Raft addresses |
| `LOVELINESS_MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES` | `16` | Max concurrent CGo calls per shard |
| `LOVELINESS_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Per-shard query timeout in milliseconds |
| `LOVELINESS_S3_BUCKET` | *(empty)* | S3 bucket for backup storage |
| `LOVELINESS_S3_REGION` | *(empty)* | AWS region for S3 |
| `LOVELINESS_S3_PREFIX` | *(empty)* | Key prefix within the S3 bucket |
| `LOVELINESS_S3_ENDPOINT` | *(empty)* | Custom S3 endpoint (MinIO, R2, etc.) |
| `LOVELINESS_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MIN` | `0` | Minutes between scheduled backups (0 = disabled) |
| `LOVELINESS_BACKUP_RETENTION` | `3` | Number of backups to retain |
| `LOVELINESS_BACKUP_DIR` | *(empty)* | Local directory for backups (when S3 is not configured) |

### Choosing shard count

Shards are fixed at cluster creation — you can't reshard later without rebuilding. Overprovision:

| Data scale | Recommended shards |
|---|---|
| < 10M nodes | 16 |
| 10M–100M | 64 |
| 100M+ | 128–256 |

Rule: your shard count is the maximum number of nodes you can ever use. 16 shards = up to 16 nodes.

## Query Optimization Phases

Loveliness applies five optimization phases to distributed queries:

### Phase A: Aggregate Merging
Rewrites `AVG(x)` to `SUM(x)` + `COUNT(x)` per shard, then merges at the router. Also handles post-merge `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `DISTINCT`.

### Phase B: Bloom Filter Routing
Per-shard probabilistic index (5M keys, 1% false positive rate, ~6MB each). Point lookups check the Bloom filter first — if only one shard reports "maybe", the query skips the other shards entirely.

### Phase C: Edge-Cut Replication
When an edge crosses shard boundaries, the target node is replicated (with full properties) to the source shard. This means 1-hop traversals almost always resolve locally without cross-shard communication.

### Phase D: Graph-Aware Partitioning
Label propagation community detection identifies tightly-connected subgraphs. Used to suggest shard migrations that reduce cross-shard edge cuts.

### Phase E: Pipeline Execution
Multi-hop traversals overlap across shards — while shard 0 processes hop 2, shard 1 processes hop 1. Reduces serial round-trip latency.

## Supported Cypher

Loveliness passes all Cypher through to LadybugDB — the router only classifies queries for routing, it doesn't validate syntax.

| Category | Clauses | Routing |
|---|---|---|
| **Reads** | `MATCH`, `OPTIONAL MATCH`, `WITH`, `UNWIND`, `CALL`, `RETURN`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` | Shard key → single shard; no key → scatter-gather |
| **Writes** | `CREATE`, `MERGE`, `SET`, `DELETE`, `DETACH DELETE`, `REMOVE` | Shard key required; routes to owning shard |
| **Schema DDL** | `CREATE NODE TABLE`, `CREATE REL TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `ALTER` | Broadcast to all shards |
| **Bulk** | `COPY FROM` | Via `/bulk/nodes` or `/bulk/edges` endpoints |

## How It Works

### Query lifecycle

1. Client sends `POST /query {"cypher": "MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Alice'}) RETURN p"}`
2. **Parser** classifies the query (read/write/schema) and extracts labels (`Person`)
3. **Schema registry** looks up Person's shard key → `name`
4. **Bloom filter** checks which shards might have `"Alice"` → shard 2
5. **Router** sends query to shard 2 only (instead of all 4)
6. If shard is local → execute directly via CGo
7. If remote → forward via TCP+msgpack to the owning node
8. Return result to client

### Write lifecycle

1. Router sends write to **primary** shard on the owning node
2. **WAL** appends the Cypher before execution (for crash recovery and replica catch-up)
3. Primary executes the Cypher against LadybugDB
4. **Replicator** fans out to replica node(s) per consistency level
5. Response returned to client

### Edge-cut replication

When Alice (shard 0) creates an edge to Bob (shard 2):
1. A **reference node** for Bob is created on shard 0 with full properties
2. The edge is stored on shard 0 (edges live with their source)
3. `MATCH (a:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:KNOWS]->(b)` resolves entirely on shard 0 — no cross-shard hop needed

### CGo safety

LadybugDB runs via CGo (go-ladybug bindings). Each shard has:
- A **semaphore** limiting concurrent CGo calls (prevents thread exhaustion)
- **Panic recovery** that catches CGo crashes and marks the shard unhealthy instead of crashing the process
- **Thread pool configuration** (`runtime.NumCPU() / shardCount` threads per shard) to prevent CPU oversubscription

## Development

```bash
# Run tests with race detector
